"""Edit transducer classes.

Edit transducers are abstract machines used to efficiently compute edit
distance and approximate string matches.

Here, we provide three concrete classes:

* EditTransducer(object): Constructs the transducer from an input alphabet and
  cost matrix. Provides a protected `_make_lattice` method for lattice
  construction, which may be overridden by derived classes.
* LevenshteinDistance(EditTransducer): Also adds a method for computing edit distance
  from the lattice.
* LevenshteinAutomaton(LevenshteinDistance): Uses the edit transducer and an input
  vocabulary to construct a right-factored lexicon, from which one can compute
  the closest matches.

One current limitation is that the library only supports "indel" (insertion
and deletion) operations, so apparent substitutions are modeled as an insertion
followed by a deletion (or vis versa). It should be straightforward to extend
this model to support substitutions, however.
